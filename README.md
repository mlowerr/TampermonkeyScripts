# Tampermonkey Scripts

A small collection of personal Tampermonkey userscripts aimed at improving everyday browsing experiences.

## File overview
- **README.md**: Explains the repository and summarizes each included userscript.
- **Reddit – highlight visited links-1.0.user.js**: Records visited Reddit links in `localStorage` and highlights them with a red outline, including links added via dynamic page changes.
- **Reddit Gallery Downloader Bar.user.js**: Injects a fixed header bar on Reddit that adds a 📥 Gallery button to download all full-resolution images from gallery posts, reappearing on SPA navigation.
- **Speedy Sites (YouTube only).user.js**: Automatically sets YouTube playback speed (default 1.5×, normal speed for live videos), provides a floating speed-control bar, and rehooks videos as the page changes.
